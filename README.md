# ðŸš¢ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic **Titanic dataset** â€” one of the most well-known datasets in data science.  
The goal is to analyze the characteristics of passengers aboard the Titanic and uncover key factors that influenced their survival chances.  

By performing detailed data exploration, visualization, and interpretation, this project provides a structured understanding of how data-driven insights can be extracted from raw datasets.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The main objective is to:
- Explore and understand the Titanic dataset structure.
- Identify patterns and correlations affecting passenger survival.
- Handle missing data and visualize meaningful trends.
- Build a foundation for future predictive modeling tasks.

##  Project Workflow and Step-by-Step Explanation

### **Step 1: Importing Essential Libraries**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
## Explanation:
The project begins by importing essential Python libraries:

- **Pandas** for data manipulation and exploration.

- **NumPy** for numerical operations.

- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization.
These tools collectively provide a strong foundation for analyzing structured datasets.

### **Step 2: Loading the Dataset**
```python
import seaborn as sns
titanic = sns.load_dataset('titanic')
```
## Explanation:
We use Seabornâ€™s built-in Titanic dataset, which contains passenger details such as age, class, gender, and survival status.
This dataset is widely used to demonstrate data analysis techniques.
Loading the dataset successfully is the first step before understanding its structure.

### **Step 3: Understanding the Dataset**
```python
titanic.shape
titanic.info()
titanic.head()
titanic.describe()
```
### Explanation:

- .shape shows the number of rows and columns â€” representing total passengers and features.

- .info() provides data types and null value information.

- .head() previews the first few rows to get a sense of the data.

- .describe() gives summary statistics for numeric columns such as mean, min, max, and standard deviation.

This step establishes a baseline understanding of what data weâ€™re dealing with.

### **Step 4: Checking for Missing Values**
```python
titanic.isnull().sum()
sns.heatmap(titanic.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='viridis')
```
### Explanation:
Missing data is common in real-world datasets.

- .isnull().sum() counts how many values are missing per column.

- The **heatmap** visually highlights where missing values exist.
This helps determine whether to fill or drop missing data based on its impact and volume.

### **Step 5: Data Cleaning**
```python
titanic['age'].fillna(titanic['age'].median(), inplace=True)
titanic.drop(['deck'], axis=1, inplace=True)
```
### Explanation:

- Missing ages are replaced with the median to retain valuable records without distorting the data.

- The deck column, which contains too many missing values, is dropped entirely.
This step ensures a cleaner, more reliable dataset for analysis.

## **Step 6: Univariate Analysis**
### a. Age Distribution
```python
sns.histplot(titanic['age'].dropna(), kde=True, bins=30)
plt.title("Age Distribution of Passengers")
plt.show()
```
![Missing Values per Column](Titanic%20EDA/Titanic%20dataset%20images/Coding%20Samurai%203.png)
### Interpretation:
The histogram shows that most passengers were between **20â€“40 years old**, suggesting that the majority on board were young adults.

### b. Passenger Class Distribution
```python
sns.countplot(x='class', data=titanic)
plt.title("Passenger Count by Class")
plt.show()
```
![Missing Values per Column](Titanic%20EDA/Titanic%20dataset%20images/Coding%20Samurai%204.png)
### Interpretation:
Most passengers were in **3rd class**, indicating that the ship had a higher number of lower-income travelers.

### c. Gender Distribution
```python
sns.countplot(x='sex', data=titanic)
plt.title("Gender Distribution of Passengers")
plt.show()
```

### Interpretation:
There were **more males** than females on board, which may influence overall survival statistics.
